Hi! I’m Nattis.

Just started to code and I don’t know exactly what I’m doing or where to go… 
I’m starting with basic frontend and I feel very thrilled by game development. 
For now, there’s not much to say… Hopefully, I’ll come back to change this read-me with tons of new knowledge. 
Wish me luck, or at least send coffee.
